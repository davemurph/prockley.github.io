Having recently been educated in the ways of data analytics at CIT Cork, I set up this blog to keep on exploring. I use Tableau data visualisation software at work but want to get better at other useful tech - R, Python, D3.js, Hadoop... (who knows what else). With any luck there'll be some interesting stuff to put up here.
