### Which Jobs are over-represented in different parts of Ireland?

##### What is being investigated here?

Using Census 2011 data, the aim was to see which occupations were most over-represented in the counties and cities of Ireland. _Are some areas over-reliant on certain types of jobs?_

##### How is this measured?

Take the example of Cork City and the occupation of 'Customer Service'. For the whole of Ireland there are 22,833 Customer Service jobs out of a total 2,232,203 jobs. So people working in this sector account for about _102 jobs out of every 10,000 overall_.

In Cork City there are 1,656 Customer Service jobs out of a total 55,328 jobs, which equates to _299 in every 10,000 jobs_.

The ratio between these two measures is the 'Location Quotient'. So for Cork City the measure for Customer Service jobs is 299 divided by 102, giving 2.9. __This means that there are 2.9 times as many Customer Service employees (per 10,000 jobs) in Cork City compared to the national average__.

_(The map below shows the data. The bigger the dot the greater the over-representation. The chart is interactive but if you pinch or zoom into a corner just refresh the page.)_
