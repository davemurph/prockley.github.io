###Gender comparison using 2011 Census data (ages 25-54)

The data used relates to the 25-54 age range. This was chosen to highlight the times when people are most likely to be working and rearing a family.  

__Labour force participation rate:__ _The labour force (those at work, looking for first regular job, and unemployed) as a percentage of the total population._

And here is the mapped data. Hover over the map for more information (_currently not reliable on smaller screens_)...

Looking at the rates for both sexes the lowest for both are found:

- Female: 70.7% (Limerick City) to 79.0% (Dublin City).
- Male: 84.4% (Limerick City) to 94.2% (Meath).

##### Oh alright...

...I'll come clean. The real reason for this post was to get started with mapping on D3 (an open-source javavscript library used to display information online). There was quite abit to it so if you're interested click [here](https://github.com/prockley).
